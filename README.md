# Library Manager application

## Description
Welcome to our project! Library Manager is a python app with an user-friendly command-line interface that allows library staff to efficiently manage its books and customers. 

This CLI utilizes an SQLite database to store records, making it easier to see, search, add, update and delete borrowed books and library users data. We hope you enjoy and we look forward to your contributions!

## Directory and file structure

The program files are located inside the /lib folder: 
- cli.py: The CLI script, with menu choices and user prompts. It calls the helper functions exit_program, list_users, show_user, create_user, delete_user, update_user, show_book, create_book_for_user, delete_book and update_book, according to the user prompts. 
- helpers.py: This file contains the helper functions above mentioned, with logic to perform basic CRUD operations. You can find a complete description of those functions further below.    
- book.py and user.py: Those files respectively contain the data model classes Book and User, both with functions for data persistence, like creating and deleting data tables, creating and deleting data table rows, properties for data validation, functions that return object per row, etc.
- debug.py: This file can be used for debugging and is also reponsible for seeding the database with mock data and resetting the database.


- __init__.py: This file creates the necessary database constants.
  
README.md and other files are in the root directory. After seeding the database, a database file called library.db will be created in the root directory.

## Installing and running the application

To install and run Library Manager, ensure that you have Python 3 and pip installed on your system.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to its directory.
2. Run pipenv install to install all the necessary package dependencies.
3. Run pipenv shell to enter the virtual environment.
4. Run python lib/debug.py to populate the database with mock data (at any time you can run this script again if you need to reset the database).
5. Run python lib/cli.py to start the command line program.

## Library Manager app functionalities

The functions located in lib/helper.py (which, in turn, reference functions in user.py and book.py) allow library staff to perform basic CRUD operations on books and customers. Those functions are: 

EXIT PROGRAM - exit_program(): It closes the application.

VIEW ALL USERS - list_users(): Displays an ordered list with all users' names. 

SHOW USER DETAILS - show_user(): Displays details of a selected user, like its address, membership level and a list of borrowed books.

ADD USER - create_user(): It adds a new library user to the database. Requires the user's name, address and membership level. 

DELETE USER - delete_user(): It permanentely deletes a selected user from the database.

EDIT AN USER - update_user(): Allows the staff member to update details of a selected library user, like name, address and membership level. This function allows it to enter an empty string in the options that are not to be updated.

SHOW BOOK DETAILS - show_book(): Displays details of a selected book, like its title, genre and user who borrowed it. 

ADD BOOK TO USER - create_book_for_user(): It adds a new book to a selected user. It requires the book's title and genre. 

DELETE BOOK - delete_book(): It permanentely deletes a selected book from the database.

EDIT A BOOK - update_book(): Allows the staff member to update details of a selected book, like title, genre and user who borrowed it. This function allows it to enter an empty string in the options that are not to be updated.
